          <p>
            Mizrmo has set up a system for booking Seats online (“Booking”) for
            Rides offered on the Platform. The methods of booking of a Seat
            depend on the nature of the Ride envisaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mizrmo provides to members on the Platform a search engine based on
            different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates,
            number of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are
            provided on the search engine when the member is connected with
            their Account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mizrmo invites the member, regardless of the booking process used,
            to carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the
            offer that is most adapted to their needs. The Customer, booking a
            Bus Ride on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the
            desk agent to do the search.

          <p>
            When a Rider is interested in an Advert benefiting from Booking,
            they may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is
            either:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when

            </li>
            <li>
              (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking,
              the Rider makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and
              the related Service Fees, where applicable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After receipt of the payment by Mizrmo and validation of the Booking
            request by the Driver, where applicable, the Rider receives a
            Booking confirmation (the “Booking Confirmation”).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Booking
            requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to
            any Booking request within the timeframe specified by the Rider
            during the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will
            expire automatically, and the Rider shall be refunded all sums paid
            at the time of the Booking request, if any.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of the Booking Confirmation, Mizrmo will grant you
            access to the telephone number and message board of the Driver (if
            you are the Rider) or of the Rider (if you are the Driver), if the
            Member agreed to display their phone number. You are then solely
            responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other
            Member.

            Mizrmo draws your attention to the fact that certain Transport
            Services offered by the Bus Operator and mentioned on the Website

            However, Mizrmo allows its Members to book one or more Seats on
            behalf of a third party. In this case, you undertake to accurately
            indicate to the Driver, at the time of the Booking, the forenames,
            age, and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are
            reserving a Seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age
            of 13 travelling alone for a Carpooling Ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case where you are reserving a seat for a minor over the age
            of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement
            of the Driver and to provide them with a duly completed and signed
            permission of their legal representatives. We further recommend
            contacting the Driver beforehand to confirm details, agree on
            pick-up/drop-off location, and arrange for someone to meet at the
            end destination.

          <p>
            For KYC check purposes, you may be asked to provide additional

          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg my-2">7.4. Refund Disputes</h2>
          <p>
            Where there is a refund dispute, members are encouraged to provide
            evidence (e.g., screenshots or communication) in support of their
            claims when requesting a review. The refund dispute will be
            processed within the next thirty (30) business days. In case of any
            disputes regarding cancellations or refunds, the decision of Mizrmo
            will be final.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a cancellation occurs before departure and owing to the Rider,
            the Seat(s) cancelled by the Rider shall be automatically made
            available to other Riders, who may book them online and they are
            accordingly subject to the conditions of these T&Cs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mizrmo appreciates, in its sole discretion, on the basis of the
            available information, the legitimacy of the refund requests.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you find that there has been an error in the calculation of the
            Cost Contribution and wish to make corrections in the calculation of
            the Cost Contribution, you must submit a petition in the section,
            “Payment” of the Platform. If a petition in the section “Payment” of
            the Platform has not been submitted, then Mizrmo shall not
            recalculate the Cost Contribution or reimburse you for an error made
            in the calculation of the Cost Contribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mizrmo may adjust the Cost Contribution for a particular order
            completed, if we detect a violation (such as taking a longer route
            or not stopping the fare meter of the Platform after the
            Transportation Services have been completed) or in case a technical
            error affecting the final fare is identified. Mizrmo may also reduce
            or cancel the Cost Contribution in case we have reasonable cause to
            suspect a fraud or a complaint by the Rider indicates a violation by
            you. Mizrmo will only exercise its right to reduce or cancel the
            fare in a reasonable and justified manner.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg my-2">7.5. Right of withdrawal</h2>
          <p>
            You have no right of withdrawal from the time of Booking
            Confirmation provided the Contract between you and Mizrmo consisting
            of putting you in contact with another Member has been fully
            executed.

            8.1. Undertaking of all Members of the Platform
          </h2>
          <p>
            You recognise being solely responsible for respecting all laws,
            regulations, and obligations applicable to your use of the Platform.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">
            8.1.1. Treat everyone with respect
          </h3>
          <p>
            Treat every Member as you would like to be treated yourself: with
            respect. The actions you take while using the Platform can have a
            big impact on the safety and comfort of others. That’s why you are
            expected to exercise good judgement and behave decently toward other
            people when using the Platform and interacting with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, always try to be on time for your Ride. It is also
            common courtesy not to shout, swear or slam doors. And by tidying up
            after yourself—whether it’s taking your rubbish home or cleaning up
            a spilt drink—you’ll help ensure that everyone has a pleasant ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, remember that when you interact with others in the
            community, you may meet people who may look different from you or
            think differently than you. Please respect those differences. We
            believe that everyone should feel supported and welcomed when
            interfacing with others in the Community.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">8.1.2. Physical contact</h3>
          <p>
            We all value our personal space and privacy. Do not touch strangers
            or anyone you just met while using the Platform. Limited exceptions
            are permitted for people needing or requesting physical assistance
            or when limited physical contact is unavoidable. Hurting or
            intending to hurt anyone is not allowed.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">
            8.1.3. Sexual assault and misconduct
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sexual assault and sexual misconduct of any kind is prohibited.
            Sexual assault and misconduct refer to sexual contact or behaviour
            without explicit consent of the other person.
          </p>
          <p>The following list provides examples of inappropriate conduct:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do not ask personal questions (for example, about relationship
              status or sexual history).
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not comment on the physical appearance of other Members (for
              example, derogatory or “complimentary” comments).
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not make explicit comments or gestures about Members or to
              Members (for example, slurs, or graphic or suggestive messages).
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not flirt (for example, nonverbal, suggestive flirting, or
              being too physically close).
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not display indecent material (for example, sexually suggestive
              objects or pictures).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">
            8.1.4. Threatening and rude behaviour
          </h3>
          <p>
            Aggressive, confrontational, or harassing behaviour is not allowed.
            Do not use language, make gestures, or take actions that could be
            disrespectful, threatening, or inappropriate. It is also a good idea
            to stay away from personal topics that can potentially be divisive,
            like religion and political beliefs.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">8.1.5. Post-Ride contact</h3>
          <p>
            Contact should end when the Ride is complete unless it is to return
            a lost item. Unwanted contact can be seen as harassment and
            includes, for example, texting, calling, social media contact,
            visiting, or trying to visit someone in person after a Ride has been
            completed. Do not share any unnecessary contact information.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">8.1.6. Non-Discrimination</h3>
          <p>
            You should always feel safe and welcome. That is why we do not
            tolerate discriminatory conduct or behaviour, including toward the
            Support team. Do not discriminate against someone based on traits
            such as their age, colour, disability, gender identity, marital or
            civil partnership status, pregnancy or maternity, national origin,
            appearance, race, religion or belief, political views, sex, or any
            other characteristic protected under relevant law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicable laws in certain jurisdictions may require and/or allow
            the provision of services by and for the benefit of a specific
            category of persons. In such jurisdictions, services as required or
            allowed by these laws and the relevant applicable terms are
            permissible under these guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>It is unacceptable to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Refuse to provide services based on characteristics like a
              person’s age, colour, disability, gender identity, marital or
              civil partnership status, pregnancy or maternity, national origin,
              appearance, race, religion or belief, political views, sex, or any
              other characteristic protected under relevant law.
            </li>
            <li>Rate another Member based on these traits.</li>
            <li>
              Discriminate on the basis of a Member’s destination. We understand
              how important it is to fit driving around your life, rather than
              the other way around. It is not a violation of these guidelines to
              decline a Ride because it does not work for you. But intentionally
              refusing or canceling requests or using features on the Platform
              to avoid requests, solely for the purpose of avoiding a particular
              neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or
              businesses that are located in that area, is not allowed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Drivers using the Platform must comply with all relevant laws
            governing the transportation of riders with disabilities, including
            transporting service animals and assistive devices (such as
            wheelchairs).
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl my-3">8.1.7. Property damage</h3>
          <p>
            Damaging property is never allowed. Some examples include damaging
            the car or other mode of transportation requested through the
            Platform, breaking, or vandalising a phone or tablet, intentionally
            spilling food, or drink, smoking in a car, damaging a merchant’s
            premises, or vomiting due to excessive alcohol consumption or
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you damage property, you are responsible for the cost of cleaning
            and repair fees, outside of normal wear and tear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, when using the Platform and during Rides, you
            undertake:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              not to use the Platform for professional, commercial, or
              profit-making purposes, if you are not a Bus Operator;

            <li>
              not to send Mizrmo (notably upon creation or updating of your
              Account) or the other Members any false, misleading, malicious, or
              fraudulent information;
            </li>
            <li>
              not to speak or behave in any way or post any content on the
              Platform of a defamatory, injurious, obscene, pornographic,
              vulgar, offensive, aggressive, uncalled-for, violent, threatening,
              harassing, racist or xenophobic nature, or with sexual
              connotations, inciting violence, discrimination or hatred,
              encouraging activities or the use of illegal substances, or more
              generally contrary to the purposes of the Platform, that may
              infringe the rights of Mizrmo or a third party or contrary to good
              morals;

              an Account in the name of a third party;
            </li>
            <li>
              not to try to bypass the online booking system of the Platform,
              notably by trying to send another Member or a Bus Operator your
              contact details in order to make the booking outside of the
              Platform and avoid paying the Service Fees;
            </li>
            <li>
              not to contact another Member, notably via the Platform, for a
              purpose other than defining the terms of the ridesharing;
            </li>
            <li>
              not to accept or make payment outside of the Platform or the In

          <p>
            The Platform constitutes an online mobility platform on which the
            Members can create and post Adverts for Carpooling Rides for the
            purposes of ridesharing. These Adverts can notably be viewed by the
            other Members to find out the terms of the Ride, and where
            applicable, to directly book a Seat in the vehicle in question with
            the Member having posted the Advert on the Platform. The Platform
            also allows the Booking of Seats for Bus Rides.
          </p>

          <p>
            In using the Platform and in accepting these T&Cs, you recognise
            that Mizrmo is not party to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any agreement entered into between you and the other Members with
              a view to sharing the costs relating to a Ride;
            </li>
            <li>
              Nor to any agreement concluded between you and a Bus Operator.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Mizrmo has no control over the behaviour of its Members, the Bus
            Operator and their agents, and the members of the Platform. It does
            not own, exploit, supply or manage the vehicles subject of the
            Adverts, and it does not offer any Rides on the Platform.

            You recognise and accept that Mizrmo does not control the validity,

            its capacity of ridesharing intermediary, Mizrmo does not provide
            any transport service and does not act in the capacity of carrier;
            the role of Mizrmo is limited to facilitating access to the
